The gui version is slow when scrolling full screen. Inefficient drawing surely.
The trick from the Windows version of the nested one should help a lot.

underlining is ugly

sometimes scrolling up or opening lines in vim doesn't work right

Nested terminal emulator inside screen inside terminal emulator loses the arrow keys.

in attach, vim with dark bg lost the highlight of the active tab on Windows nested - vim tries to underline it. we'll have to support that somehow

a lot of CPU is wasted when doing mplayer

using mplayer and detaching in the middle of it seems to f things up... sometimes, maybe it has to do with a long running process instead


FEATURE REQUESTS:
	rectangular selection
	window manager hints for resizing in cell-sized chunks
	setting colors on the command line

	bell enable/disable sequence (mutt's beeps annoy me but i like most beeps)

	terminal emulator widget that can be embedded elsewhere
	libssh2 support
	scripting support???
	use it in another program really easily to just pop up



If I didn't write that event loop lib myself, would I have ever figured it out? If I did, would I have been able to fix it so easily?
